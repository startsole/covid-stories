              subtitle="Teaching and learning during a pandemic is no easy task, as we all learned during Covid-19. There were many challenges, but my students and I decided to commit to documenting the stories of local people affected by the pandemic as it happened. It was a small, but important snapshot in helping to understand the dizzying events that engulfed the world. I hope you enjoy the results of the studentsâ€™ efforts, and even consider adding some of your own."
